This repository shows the part of my research project for the Data Management and Visualization course on Coursera.

USED DATASET:
# NESARC
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth) is a representative school-based survey of adolescents in grades 7-12 
in the United States. The Wave 1 survey focuses on factors that may influence adolescentsâ€™ health and risk behaviors, including personal 
traits, families, friendships, romantic relationships, peer groups, schools, neighborhoods, and communities. 

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
This repository is about the association between the age when started drinking and alcohol abuse and/or dependence. 
Also I would like to further investigate if there are correlation between the age when started drinking and if blood/natural mother or father
ever was an alcoholic or problem drinker.
