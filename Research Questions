My research questions and hypotheses are as follows:

## Research Question I
“Is there an association between the age when started drinking and alcohol abuse and/or dependence?”

Ho (Null Hypothesis): The age when started drinking (S2AQ19) is not associated with alcohol abuse/dependence (ALCABDEP12DX). 
Ha (Alternative Hypothesis): The age when started drinking (S2AQ19) is associated with alcohol abuse/dependence (ALCABDEP12DX).

## Research Question II
“Is there an association between the age when started drinking and if blood/natural mother or father ever was an alcoholic or problem drinker?”

Ho (Null Hypothesis): The age when started drinking (S2AQ19) is not associated with natural parents alcohol abuse/dependence (S2DQ1 & S2DQ2). 
Ha (Alternative Hypothesis): The age when started drinking (S2AQ19) is associated with natural parents alcohol abuse/dependence (S2DQ1 & S2DQ2)

## Literature review
For literature review I used Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com), to see what research has been previously done on my 
chosen research topic. The search term used was “association between the age when started drinking and alcohol abuse and dependence.” 
The summary of my literature review for the project is as follows:

The age when started drinking (S2AQ19) has been considered as a potentially powerful predictor for alcohol abuse and dependence (ALCABDEP12DX).
The study results could be important policy implications for the development of alcohol-abuse prevention programs for youth.
The 1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic survey indicated that individuals who started drinking at ages 14 or younger 
became alcohol dependent, four times the rate (10%) observed for those who started reported drinking at ages 20 and older.
