My research questions and hypotheses are as follows:

# Research Question I
“Is there an association between the age when started drinking and alcohol abuse and/or dependence?”

Ho (Null Hypothesis): The age when started drinking (S2AQ19) is not associated with alcohol abuse/dependence (ALCABDEP12DX). 
Ha (Alternative Hypothesis): The age when started drinking (S2AQ19) is associated with alcohol abuse/dependence (ALCABDEP12DX).

# Research Question II
“Is there an association between the age when started drinking and if blood/natural mother or father ever was an alcoholic or problem drinker?”

Ho (Null Hypothesis): The age when started drinking (S2AQ19) is not associated with natural parents alcohol abuse/dependence (S2DQ1 & S2DQ2). 
Ha (Alternative Hypothesis): The age when started drinking (S2AQ19) is associated with natural parents alcohol abuse/dependence (S2DQ1 & S2DQ2)

# Literature review
For literature review I used Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com), to see what research has been previously done on my 
chosen research topic. The search term used was “association between the age when started drinking and alcohol abuse and dependence.” and
"association between  alcohol abuse of parents and the age when started drinking"
The summary of my literature review for the project is as follows:

The age when started drinking (S2AQ19) has been considered as a potentially powerful predictor for alcohol abuse and dependence (ALCABDEP12DX).
There have been numerous studies on the research question, the association between the age at first alcohol use and alcohol abuse and/or dependence 
(DeWit, et al, 2000; Grant et al, 1997, 2001, 2004; Hingson et al, 2006, 2009). One of the studies is Grant et al (1997), he interviewd 
27,616 current and former drinkers and investigated the relationship between age at first use of alcohol and the prevalence of lifetime alcohol abuse 
and alcohol dependence. The 1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic survey indicated that individuals who started drinking at ages 
14 or younger became alcohol dependent, four times the rate (10%) observed for those who started reported drinking at ages 20 and older. 
The study results could be important policy implications for the development of alcohol-abuse prevention programs for youth.

Another study showed that both  the  age  at  onset  of  alcohol  use  and  a  family history of alcoholism can influence a person’s risk of
becoming alcohol dependent. Among  all  variables however,  people who had family  history  of  alcoholism had  a  higher  prevalence for
a  lifetime  alcohol dependence  than  did  people  without family history of alcoholism.

Finally the survey showed that earlyonset drinking cannot be viewed solely as a marker or early indicator of a family history of 
alcoholism! Not only people with family history began to drink early and therefore were at increased risk for lifetime alcohol dependence.
